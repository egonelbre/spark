Great programming
=================

I would like to tell you what great programming is and how to get there, unfortunately I can't. (This doesn't stop me from writing about it.)

	I had my moment of enlightenment when watching Alan Kay-s talk "Programming and Scaling", where he talks about the scale of things. 

	* MS Vista = ~120,000,000+ lines of code = 6,000 books
	* MS Apps = ~140,000,000+ lines of code = 7,000 books

	This amount of code is unmaintainable and it's not possible to verify it's reliabilty easily. This means there must be a better way of doing things.

	The next thing he showed was Nile/Gezira a vector rendering library in ~3000LOC that includes the language implementation and all different compositing operations. And let's make an unfair comparison to something like Skia or Cairo that have +1,000,000LOC. (Unfair because Nile/Gezire doesn't have all the features of Skia and Cairo).

	Anyway, I started to think - what if and how we could all program like this. Making a code reduction in every system by a factor of 100. What is the minimal amount of code to be precise, fast, scalable and understandable.

The way we get to great programming is by asking questions, questioning our assumptions and criticising everything... and also imagining a better way of doing things. We also should constantly try to reinvent things - and using as much knowledge from history as possible. When we have great examples that people can learn from we will start to move towards great programming.

In this sense projects, such as Viewpoint Research Institutes STEPS project that tries to implement personal computing experience under 20,000LOC, will give us valuable insight and new techniques to work with. Even if people won't start using it, it would be still an impressive feat of programming, engineering, mathematics and art.

It's wise to listen to smarter people than yourself. The people I listen to are Alan Kay, Rich Hickey, Gerald Jay Sussman and Carlo Pescio. Mainly because they make me question my own assumptions/techniques. They don't just talk about the implementation, but they talk about things on a philosophical level.

Maybe someday I can write more about this topic, for now I don't consider myself smart enough.
